             when we copy the JSON file contents here in the script tag its read as JavaScript. 
            When you launch the HTML file and go to Inspect -> console, you'll see 
            the JSON contents of the companies array there. -->

                /*if you use `` at the beginning and end of companies array, it gets converted to a string
                and when you console.log it, you only get a string output in web console.
                That is why JSON.parse parses the string into JSON objects. You can avoid this step though
                by not using a string array in the first place for this example, but in the cases you need that
                JSON.parse is incredibly helpful */
