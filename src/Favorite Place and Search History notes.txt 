    Firebase Authentication:
        Set up Firebase Authentication to handle user registration and login.
        Use Firebase Authentication to manage user sessions and secure access to the app's features.

    Firestore Database:
        Set up Firebase Firestore, a NoSQL document database, to store the user data.
        Create a collection called "Users" to store user-specific data.
        When a user registers or logs in, create a document in the "Users" collection with their unique user ID.
        Within the user document, create two subcollections: "FavoritePlaces" and "SearchHistory".

    Favorite Places:
        When a user marks a place as a favorite, add the place data to the "FavoritePlaces" subcollection under their user document.
        Each favorite place can be stored as a separate document within the "FavoritePlaces" subcollection.
        The document can contain relevant information about the place, such as its name, location, weather data, etc.

    Search History:
        Whenever a user performs a search, store the searched place data in the "SearchHistory" subcollection under their user document.
        Similar to the favorite places, each search history entry can be stored as a separate document within the "SearchHistory" subcollection.

By structuring the data in this way, you can easily retrieve and display the favorite places and search history for each user.
You can use Firebase's SDK and APIs to perform CRUD operations on the database and keep the data synchronized in real-time
between the client and the server.

Remember to set appropriate security rules in Firebase to ensure that only authenticated users can access and modify their 
own data. This implementation allows users to have their personalized favorite places and search history associated with 
their accounts. You can customize the data model and fields based on your specific requirements and the information you 
want to store for each place.

Structure your Realtime Database

    Determine the structure of your database. In this case, you want to store previously searched places for each user. You can structure it like this:
        users
            [user_id]
                searched_places
                    [search_id]
                        place_name: "Place Name"
                        timestamp: "2023-05-22T12:34:56Z"
                    [search_id]
                        place_name: "Another Place"
                        timestamp: "2023-05-21T09:00:00Z"
                favorites
                    [favorite_id]
                        place_name: "Favorite Place"
                        timestamp: "2023-05-20T15:30:00Z"
                    [favorite_id]
                        place_name: "Another Favorite"
                        timestamp: "2023-05-19T18:45:00Z"

Step 4: Save previously searched places

    When a user performs a search and you want to save it as a previously searched place:
        Retrieve the currently logged-in user's ID from the authentication system.
        Generate a unique ID for the search (e.g., using the push() method or generating a UUID).
        Create a new child node under the user's searched_places node with the generated ID.
        Set the desired data for the searched place (e.g., place_name, timestamp).
        Save the data to the Realtime Database using the appropriate method provided by the Firebase SDK for your platform.

Step 5: Retrieve previously searched places

    To retrieve a user's previously searched places:
        Retrieve the currently logged-in user's ID from the authentication system.
        Read the searched_places node under the user's ID.
        Iterate over the child nodes to access each previously searched place's data.

Step 6: Update and delete previously searched places

    To update or delete a previously searched place:
        Retrieve the currently logged-in user's ID from the authentication system.
        Access the specific child node under the searched_places node for the place you want to update or delete.
        Update or delete the relevant data using the appropriate method provided by the Firebase SDK for your platform.
